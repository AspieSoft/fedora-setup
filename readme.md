# Fedora Setup

Completely Transform a new Fedora WorkStation install.

To put things simply, these changes are not big enough to make a full linux distro, but this script tries to act like one.
This script also adds an auto update checker, to automatically add in new features when a new version is released on the [github repo](https://github.com/AspieSoft/fedora-setup).

Note: Creating a backup of your distro before running this script is recommended.

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/AspieSoft/fedora-setup.git && fedora-setup/setup.sh
```
